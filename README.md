**Deep Reinforcement learning** has gained a lot of traction in the past few years, from [playing various Atari 
games](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/), 
[defeating professionals at the game of Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) and [DoTA2](https://blog.openai.com/openai-five-benchmark-results/). Deepmind and OpenAI are the major players when it comes to deep 
reinforcement learning. A lot of real world applications has been off the charts in terms of achievement. Here, I 
explore the field and implement various problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
